									<p>Through the project, we achieved a 7.5% ratio of expected losses to the total financed amount, it divided into 4 parts:<br />
									   	1. Data preparation: we cleaned the data and created columns from useful, close to each other data.<br />
									   	2. We made a PD model from useful data.<br />
									        3. Monitoring: At this stage we compared the Actual and Probable results, at this stage we received the data of 2015 (load_data_2015)<br />
									        4. LGD, EAD, and EL: In the last step, we made LGD, EAD models and put all the models into one DataFrame and found EL through them.

								</header>
								<a href="https://github.com/barkamoljon/Resume_Parser"target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/Resume-Parsing.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The Resume Parser with NLP is a program that uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract essential information from resumes. 
								  The program receives resumes in PDF format, and it processes them using several NLP techniques to extract personal and professional details such as name, email, phone number, work experience, education, skills, and other relevant information.

								  The program uses several Python libraries such as spaCy, PyPDF2, and Regex to perform NLP tasks such as tokenization, parsing, 
								  named-entity recognition, and information extraction. It also uses machine learning models to classify the information and extract specific details.

								  The program is designed to automate the resume screening process, making it more efficient and accurate. 
								  It can be used by HR departments or recruitment agencies to quickly identify the most promising candidates and filter out irrelevant applications.

								  Overall, the Resume Parser with NLP is a powerful tool that streamlines the recruitment process and helps organizations find and hire the best candidates for their open positions.</p>

								<a href="https://github.com/barkamoljon/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Time%20Series%20Forecasting"target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/time_series.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The goal of this project is to demonstrate time series forecasting using the FBProphet library in Python. The dataset used in the project is the daily number of passengers for an airline company, spanning from 2018 to 2020. 
							               The project involves data preprocessing, visualization, modeling, forecasting, and evaluation of the model.

								   In data preprocessing, the "Month" column is parsed, the columns are renamed, and the "Passengers" column is converted to a numeric type. In data visualization, the time series data is plotted to visualize the trend and seasonality.

								   In modeling, a Prophet model is created and fit to the data. The model is trained on the first 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%. In forecasting, the model is used to forecast the number of passengers for the next few years.

								   In evaluation, the performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error. 
								      In visualization, the forecasted data is plotted along with the historical data to visualize the accuracy of the model.

								   The project demonstrates that FBProphet can be used to effectively forecast time series data. The model accurately captures the trend and seasonality of the data and provides valuable insights for decision-making. 
									The notebook can be used as a guide for those interested in learning how to use FBProphet for time series forecasting.</p>

								<p>The Amazon Web Scraper Project is a Python-based project that focuses on scraping data from Amazon's website using the BeautifulSoup library. 
								   It can automatically extract product data from Amazon 86,400 times a day through Python libraries and generate product Dataset
                                                                   The project involves collecting information on product names, prices, ratings, and descriptions from Amazon's Best Sellers page. 
								   The data collected is then stored in a CSV file for future analysis. The code is heavily commented, making it easy for beginners to understand, and provides ample opportunities for customization or further development. 
						     		   The project is an excellent way to learn about web scraping, data handling, and Python programming as a whole. By the end of the project, developers will have gained a valuable skillset that they can apply to numerous other projects.</p>

								<p>The "Developer ChatBot with ChatGPT API" is a project that aims to develop a chatbot using the ChatGPT API to assist developers with their programming-related queries. The project is developed in a Jupyter Notebook, which allows for easy implementation and execution of the code.
								   The chatbot is implemented using a while loop, which keeps running until the user types "bye" to end the conversation. The ChatGPT API is used to generate the responses of the chatbot. To use the API, you need to send a POST request to the API endpoint with the user's input as the query parameter. The API returns a JSON object containing the response of the chatbot, which is then displayed to the user.
								   The project is a valuable tool for any programming community as it provides instant solutions to users' queries. It can be customized to suit different requirements, making it an excellent tool for developers who want to create a chatbot to help other developers. Overall, the "Developer ChatBot with ChatGPT API" project is an excellent example of how machine learning can be used to develop intelligent chatbots to assist users with their queries.</p>

								<h2><a href="#">Absenteeism Correlation <br />

							    <a href="https://github.com/barkamoljon/PortfolioProjects/tree/main/Absenteeism"target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="./images/absenteeism.jpg"alt="" /></a>
							    <p>This portfolio project is an analysis of a dataset on absenteeism in a company. The dataset includes various attributes, such as the reason for absence, the date of absence, the transportation expense, and others, for each employee. 
							       The project aims to identify the most common reasons for employee absenteeism, and to build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether an employee is likely to be absent or not.

								The analysis of the data revealed that the most common reasons for absenteeism were related to diseases and medical appointments, followed by various other personal reasons, 
								and then work-related reasons. Further analysis showed that certain factors, such as age, distance from work, and work load, were significant predictors of absenteeism.

								To build a predictive model, the dataset was split into a training set and a test set. Different machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, 
								were applied to the training set, and their performance was evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

								The best-performing model was the random forest algorithm, which achieved an accuracy of 80% on the test set. 
								The model was also able to identify the most important predictors of absenteeism, such as the reason for absence, the day of the week, and the age of the employee.

								In conclusion, this project demonstrates the usefulness of data analysis and machine learning in identifying patterns and predicting outcomes in employee absenteeism. 
								The insights and models developed in this project can be used by managers and HR professionals to better understand and manage employee absenteeism in their companies.</p>
