									<p>Through the project, we achieved a 7.5% ratio of expected losses to the total financed amount, it divided into 4 parts:<br />
									   	1. Data preparation: we cleaned the data and created columns from useful, close to each other data.<br />
									   	2. We made a PD model from useful data.<br />
									        3. Monitoring: At this stage we compared the Actual and Probable results, at this stage we received the data of 2015 (load_data_2015)<br />
									        4. LGD, EAD, and EL: In the last step, we made LGD, EAD models and put all the models into one DataFrame and found EL through them.

								<p>The "Developer ChatBot with ChatGPT API" is a project that aims to develop a chatbot using the ChatGPT API to assist developers with their programming-related queries. The project is developed in a Jupyter Notebook, which allows for easy implementation and execution of the code.
								   The chatbot is implemented using a while loop, which keeps running until the user types "bye" to end the conversation. The ChatGPT API is used to generate the responses of the chatbot. To use the API, you need to send a POST request to the API endpoint with the user's input as the query parameter. The API returns a JSON object containing the response of the chatbot, which is then displayed to the user.
								   The project is a valuable tool for any programming community as it provides instant solutions to users' queries. It can be customized to suit different requirements, making it an excellent tool for developers who want to create a chatbot to help other developers. Overall, the "Developer ChatBot with ChatGPT API" project is an excellent example of how machine learning can be used to develop intelligent chatbots to assist users with their queries.</p>
